## TERM PROJECT:
This project aims to develop a software application specifically designed for the Filipino community and for others wanting authentic Filipino food in Vancouver, British Columbia. The project allows users to order food based on the current weather. The project provides a personalized food browsing experience that adjusts its recommendations based on the weather conditions, such as offering warm comfort food on a rainy day or ice cream cravings on a hot sunny day.

Furthermore, the project enhances the convenience of ordering Filipino cuisine by curating a list of authentic Filipino food from the restaurants, with an easy to navigate and user-friendly interface that connects users to the restaurants for quick pick-up orders. 

Key Features:

1.	Weather-based Food Recommendations. 
The app integrates food suggestions based on today’s weather. For example, during rainy weather or a cold morning, the application will give out appropriate suggestions like sinigang (sour soup consisting of fruits of the tamarind tree) or arroz caldo (rice porridge).

2.	Restaurant Listings and Direct Contact for Pickup.
After selecting food items, users are provided with the restaurant’s details, including the name, address, and contact information to call for easy pick-up arrangements (considering most Filipino restaurants have the choice of dine-in, take-out, or pick-up.) 
This project will also highlight and feature Filipino restaurants in Vancouver, British Columbia, giving fellow Filipinos in the local food industry a platform to reach their community more effectively.

3.	User-friendly Interface
This project aims to develop a simple, intuitive design focused on seamless navigation for the intended users that can quickly browse and select from food categories. 
	



Benefits:

1.	Community-Centric – a focus on Filipino cuisine caters to the growing Filipino community in Vancouver, allowing them to enjoy familiar food from their culture easily.

2.	Personalized Experience – weather-based suggestions add a unique touch to the user experience, making meal choices more intuitive and enjoyable that also applies to users who cannot decide on what they want on that particular day.

3.	Local Business Support – this project will promote Filipino-owned restaurants and food businesses, connecting them directly with their direct audience.

This project will not only simplify the process of ordering food for the Filipino community but also add a layer of personalization by integrating weather into the food selection process. By directly linking users with the restaurants whether for pick-up, or dining in and taking out, the project ensures an efficient service that meets the demands of Vancouver’s diverse Filipino population
